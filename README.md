#Tables to Linked Data

##Stanbol Enhancement Engine

Intended to be an "out of the box" process for transforming tabular data to
Linked Data. Detects common column names (e.g., from a CSV) and maps them to
RDF using the most suitable vocabulary terms.

##Requirements
The data transformation uses [Tarql](https://github.com/cygri/tarql).
